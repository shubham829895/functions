        "\n",
        " 1 . Iterables\n",
        "\n",
        " . An iterable is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time, making it usable in a for loop or with other iteration tools like map, filter, and list comprehensions.\n",
        "\n",
        " . Common examples of iterables include data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and strings. These objects have an __iter__() method, which allows them to return an iterator when needed\n",
        "\n",
        " .  Essentially, if an object can be looped over, it’s considered an iterable.\n",

        "  numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",

        "    print(num)\n",
        "\n",
        "2 .  Iterators\n",
        "\n",
        " .An iterator is a special object that enables Python to fetch items from an iterable one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        ". You can get an iterator from an iterable by calling iter() on it. The iterator itself has a __next__() method, which returns the next item from the sequence each time it’s called. Once the items are exhausted, __next__() raises a StopIteration exception\n",
        "\n",
        " .Iterators are stateful, meaning they remember where they are in the iteration process. They’re also \"lazy,\" as they fetch elements only when requested, which is useful for working with large or even infinite sequences.\n",

        "Answer- : A lambda function in Python is a small anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with the def keyword, lambda functions are typically used for short, simple operations where the function body is a single expression. They can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression, which is evaluated and returned.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "lambda arguments: expression\n",
        "Where arguments: The input parameters for the function (can be multiple, separated by commas).\n",

        " Answer- : The map() function in Python is a built-in function used to apply a specified function to each item of an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string) and return a map object (which is an iterator). The main purpose of map() is to facilitate functional programming by enabling transformation or computation on iterable elements in a concise and efficient manner\n",
